Our next PCC event will take place on 4th March at Eight Club Moorgate. We have the pleasure of speaking to Henry Balani about why the Blockchain matters – and why it is different from Bitcoin. His presentation examines the fundamentals of the Blockchain – what it is, why it is useful, and how it is different from Bitcoin. By now nearly everyone has heard of crypto-currencies.
